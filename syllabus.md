# Overview

This course will prepare you to conduct empirical research in political science, with a focus on linear regression models.  You should come away from this course an informed consumer and user of the most prevalent statistical techniques in political science.  You will also learn to appreciate the connections between statistical practices, research ethics, and the ongoing crisis of confidence in the sciences.


# Grading

Your grade will be based on:

* Weekly problem sets (40%).
* Midterm exam (20%).
* Final paper (30%).
* Peer review of final paper drafts (10%).

I will not accept late assignments except in case of a documented family or medical emergency.


# Software

<!-- See https://github.com/jennybc/stat540_2014/blob/master/homework/hw_submission-instructions.md, maybe make separate handout? -->

All analysis will be conducted in R.  You must write and submit your problem sets in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format,  which allows you to embed R code and its output, including graphs, directly in a document.  You will submit assignments by pushing to a GitHub repository.  I will not accept assignments by email.  Don't even think about printing them out.  We will discuss homework submission policies---and, along the way, the basics of Git and GitHub---in the first class or recitation.  There will be a separate handout laying out the details.

If you are not yet comfortable with the basics of R, here are some hands-on tutorials I recommend completing before the start of the semester:

* Swirl: <http://swirlstats.com>
* Data Camp: <https://www.datacamp.com>

Some other useful resources on R include:

* Jared Lander, *R for Everyone*: <http://amzn.com/0321888030>
* Patrick Burns, *The R Inferno*: <http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf> (best consulted when you run into weird error messages or other unexpected behavior)
* R wizard Hadley Wickham's guide to advanced programming in R: <http://adv-r.had.co.nz> (especially the coding style guide <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>)


# Collaboration Policy

Your work in this course must be the product of your own intellectual labor.  Although it is important to learn how to collaborate and co-author, at this stage of your academic careers it is even more crucial that you *personally* comprehend the basic principles of statistics and data analysis.  I expect you to follow these rules:

* You may work with, at most, one other student on each assignment.  If you choose to do so, you must include a note at the beginning of your assignment specifying who you worked with.

* You must write everything you turn in.  You may not directly copy any wording or code written by another student.  As a corollary, this means I expect you to understand---and thus be able to answer questions about---all code you turn in.

* No collaboration of any kind is allowed on the midterm.

I consider any violation of these guidelines a violation of the university's Honor Code, and I will deal with such a violation accordingly.


# Books

Two textbooks are required:

* Jeff Leek, *The Elements of Data Analytic Style*.  E-book available from <https://leanpub.com/datastyle>.

* Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach*.[^wooldridge-ed]

I recommend, but do not require, supplementing the selections from Wooldridge with their corresponding treatments in any or all of these more advanced books:

* William H. Greene, *Econometric Analysis*.

* Jack Johnston and John DiNardo, *Econometric Methods*.

* Russell Davidson and James G. MacKinnon, *Estimation and Inference in Econometrics*.

* Michael Kutner, Christopher Nachtsheim, and John Neter, *Applied Linear Regression Models*.

* Frank E. Harrell, Jr., *Regression Modeling Strategies*.

* Cosma Shalizi, *Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View*.  E-book available from <http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/>.

The last three of these are particularly useful supplements to Wooldridge, since they're by statisticians rather than econometricians.

[^wooldridge-ed]: Chapter numbers in the syllabus correspond to the 6th edition, but any edition is fine.
