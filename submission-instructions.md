**Revised January 14, 2016.**

With GitHub Classroom not working so well, as a backup you will submit assignments via email.  Your email should go to both Brenton and Matt.  It should include as attachments the following files (either individually or as a `.zip` file):

* The R Markdown source (`.rmd`)
* Its self-contained HTML output (`.html`)
* Any files you have been asked to create in the assignment (e.g., `final-data.csv` in Assignment 1)

I will still distribute data and (if necessary) starter code through a GitHub repository.  You should clone the repository for this course, <https://github.com/brentonk/psci8357>, to your computer via GitHub Desktop.  You can use the "Sync" button to download new updates after I post them.
